# Readiness tracker

**Numbered series: ready for human review 992 of 14,998 orders (6.6%)**

Unnumbered series (class catalogued_unnumbered, a separate denominator): not measured yet; `jobs/domesday-register/output/UNNUMBERED_SUMMARY.json` is missing.

Generation: `42340069449-1:a3b17cc3dedca448dfe242d156c4ef1f2bfbd7a686d8a3495685dce74bcb41ef` (the same id is in SUMMARY.json, READINESS_BY_ORDER.csv and STATUS.json).

An order is ready when the machines have finished every step it needs: each step is backed by a saved
source or a claim that passes the Stage 19 claim gate, or is recorded as searched to the end in
`research/readiness/EXHAUSTED.jsonl`. Human verification is a later, separate count.

Orders with a provisional YES/NO status: 4,298. The other 10,700 have not been researched yet.

Ready by text evidence: {'original_supported': 660, 'transcription_dependent': 332}. Provisional working texts do not authenticate originals.
Outstanding original replacement obligations: 867; quotation rechecks: 867. These remain work after readiness.

Text step provisional on a confirmed working text (separate from `done`, never an original; owner ruling 2026-10-31): 281. Confirmations rejected: {'grade_not_a_working_text_grade': 3, 'not_confirmed': 4818}.

## Steps finished (orders with a provisional status)

| Complete inventory of the order's operative clauses | 1,236 | 4,298 | 28.8% |
| When and how it ended (NO), or what keeps it operating now (YES) | 1,017 | 4,298 | 23.7% |
| Savings clauses and surviving effects closed | 1,223 | 4,298 | 28.5% |
| Search for later contrary sources recorded, no open conflicts | 2,871 | 4,298 | 66.8% |
| Every shared legal source it cites has been retrieved | 212 | 236 | 89.8% |

## Do these first: one action, many orders

| Orders unblocked | Kind | Action |
|---:|---|---|
| 2,269 | machine job | Fetch an official original for orders held only as a compiled transcription (Richardson, APP): orders from 1936 on were printed in the Federal Register (fr-originals / source-ladder route); earlier ones need an official compilation or archival copy |
| 594 | agent check | Check the page location of fr-originals and official-compilation finds marked medium/low confidence |
| 431 | machine job | Re-fetch the PDFs Opus downloaded but left out of its release: add their URLs to research/readiness/FETCH_QUEUE.jsonl |
| 10 | agent check | Compare the ProQuest replica scan's pages with the order (pinakes-proquest-ingest ORDERS.csv, texts/) and use the scan as provisional working text under the 2026-10-21 owner rulings (proquest-request, transcription-as-text), disclosed and rechecked against an original when one is held |
| 10 | one source | Retrieve shared source EO::4314 |
| 6 | one source | Retrieve shared source EO::6868 |
| 3 | one source | Retrieve shared source EO::6964 |
| 3 | one source | Retrieve shared source EO::6910 |
| 2 | one source | Retrieve shared source CFR::26 CFR 458.324 |
| 1 | agent check | Settle ambiguous Opus media matches (MATCHES.csv rows graded ambiguous) |

## How to move an order forward

- Add or extend its claim in `research/readiness/claims/*.jsonl` (format: `research/stage19/CLAIM_SCHEMA.md`).
  Partial claims count: each step lights up once its part passes the gate and claim-checker.
- Start from the order's draft in `jobs/claim-drafts/output/` (see `jobs/claim-drafts/AGENT_GUIDE.md`).
- Need a source? Add it to `research/readiness/FETCH_QUEUE.jsonl`; source-ladder fetches it.
- If a step cannot be finished by machine, add a line to `research/readiness/EXHAUSTED.jsonl` with
  `instrument_id`, `step`, `searched` (list of repositories and queries), `recorded_by`, `recorded_on`.
- Step names: `provisional_status`, `original_text`, `clause_inventory`, `ending_or_current_basis`, `savings_residuals`, `counterevidence`, `shared_sources`, `opus_media`.
- Per-order detail is in `READINESS_BY_ORDER.csv`.
