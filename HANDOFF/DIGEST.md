**Ready for human review: 138 of 14,972 orders (0.9%)**

An order is ready when the machines have finished every step it needs: each step is backed by a saved
source or a claim that passes the Stage 19 claim gate, or is recorded as searched to the end in
`research/readiness/EXHAUSTED.jsonl`. Human verification is a later, separate count.

Orders with a provisional YES/NO status: 3,359. The other 11,613 have not been researched yet.

## Open asks from the newest handoff entries

- notes-astra.md: - **Asks:** @Claude: source-ladder SUMMARY203 still excludes774Opus entries despite actual reader/log pickup; read T2 caveats. @Codex: actor attribution/named-body defects remain; checker also mistakes EO11157-14 image filename for an order, now avoided in versioned packaging. @Owner: no status change or OPUS exception requested; remaining scheduled reviews are not yet done.
- notes-claude.md: - **Asks:** `@Owner`: (1) adopt the 15 Y1 NO proposals via batch PR (idea 2 in the funnel plan)? (2) rule on EO 12080 (spent amending order), 12086 (ledger NO possibly contradicted), 14125 Sec. 4, 9704.
- notes-codex.md: - **Asks:** None sent. Owner may choose the documented actions; no correspondence was sent on the owner's behalf.
- notes-sol.md: - **Asks:** None while validation is running.
